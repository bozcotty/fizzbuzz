So, I had to do some basic review of writing methods in ruby as its been a while since I've done ruby w/o rails.

Once I recalled syntax, I knew I just needed to write a basic if/elsif/else statement inside the method, which evaluated one parameter I called num.

I hope it's ok that I ran some tests below the method itself (and kept those lines in the file)!
